1. Open the **v*X* of *X*** list and select the version that you want to revert to\.

1. Choose **Edit**, choose the appropriate editor for the file, such as **Companion App**, then choose **Yes** to lock the file\.

1. In the editor, save the file to your local drive\. If prompted, overwrite the existing file\.

1. In Amazon WorkDocs open the **Actions** list and choose **Upload new version**\.

   The **Open** dialog box appears\.
