**Other common actions**

You can also take these actions on folders\. This guide assumes you know how to:

+ Rename folders\.
+ Move folders\. Folders moved out of Amazon WorkDocs Drive go to the recycle bin on your Amazon WorkDocs site\. For example, say you move a folder from Amazon WorkDocs Drive to your hard drive\. In that case, Amazon WorkDocs moves the online instance of the folder to the recycle bin\.
+ Delete folders\. Deleted folders also go to the recycle bin in Amazon WorkDocs\.
