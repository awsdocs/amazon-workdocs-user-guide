# Opening Amazon WorkDocs Drive folders<a name="open-files-folders"></a>

You open folders in Amazon WorkDocs Drive the same way that you open folders on a regular drive\. Just remember that Amazon WorkDocs Drive appears as drive **W:**\. 

**Note**  
By default, Amazon WorkDocs Drive displays two folders — `My Documents` and `Shared With Me` — plus any folders that you create\. You can take actions on those folders, such as copying their web links or opening them in your browser\. For more information, see [Taking actions on folders](folder-actions.md)\.
