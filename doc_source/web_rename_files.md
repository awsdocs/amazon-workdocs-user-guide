# Renaming files<a name="web_rename_files"></a>

You can rename files if you have the ownership role for those files\. For more information about roles, see [Permissions](permissions.md)\.

**Important**  
Make sure your file names only contain allowed characters\. For information about characters to avoid, see [Naming files](client-name-files.md)\.
