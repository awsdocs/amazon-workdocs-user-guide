# Moving folders<a name="move-folders"></a>

You can move folders in the web client if you have the ownership role for those folders\. For more information about roles, see [Permissions](permissions.md)\.

**To move a folder**

1. Use the credentials provided by your administrator to log in to the Amazon WorkDocs web client\.

1. In the web client, select the check box next to the folder you want to move\.
**Note**  
Just select the check box\. Choosing the folder name opens the folder in Preview mode, and that disables the **Move** command\.

1. Open the **Actions** list, choose **More**, and then choose **Move**\.

1. In the dialog box, navigate to the target folder and choose **Move**\.

**Note**  
Moving a folder also moves the files and sub\-folders within the folder\. To move multiple files at the same time, move them into a folder, and then move that folder\.
