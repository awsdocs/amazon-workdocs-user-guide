# Creating folders<a name="web_create_folder"></a>

You can only create folders in the Amazon WorkDocs web client\. You can create the following types of folders: 
+ Individual folders\. You can keep individual folders for your own use, or share them with other users in your Amazon WorkDocs organization\.
+ Team folders\. You create a team folder by inviting your team directory group to share the folder\. If you don't have a team directory group, ask your Amazon WorkDocs site administrator to create one\. Your administrator is the person who invited you to join Amazon WorkDocs\. 

You can create folders in these locations:
+ Your **MyDocs** folder\.
+ In the folders that you create in your **My Docs** folder\.
+ In folders that others share with you, if you have owner or co\-owner permissions to the shared folders\.

**Note**  
As you create sub\-folders, remember that Amazon WorkDocs only displays the first 260 characters of a folder path\.

**To create a folder**

1. Use the credentials provided by your administrator to log in to the Amazon WorkDocs web client\.

1. Make sure you're in the correct location for the new folder\.

1. Open the **Create** menu and choose **Folder**\.

   The **Create Folder** dialog box appears\.

1. Enter a name for the folder, and then choose **Create**\.
**Note**  
Be careful when entering folder names\. Using characters such as periods \(**\.**\) and tildes \(**\~**\) prevents your administrator from migrating your folders\. As a result, you may find your data on a slower server, or your data may not be available if you move to a different Amazon WorkDocs group\. For more information, see [Naming files](client-name-files.md)

**To create a sub folder**

1. In the Amazon WorkDocs web client, open the folder that will contain the sub folder\.

1. Open the **Create** menu and choose **Folder**\.

1. Enter a name for the sub folder, and then choose **Create**\.

**To create a team folder**

1. Follow the previous steps to create a folder\.

1. Send an invitation to share the folder with your team directory group\. For more information on sharing folders by invitation, see [Sharing by invitation](share-invite.md)\. Your team members will have the permissions that you set when you create the invitation\.
