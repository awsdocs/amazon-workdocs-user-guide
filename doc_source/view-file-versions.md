# Using past versions of a file<a name="view-file-versions"></a>

You can use past versions of a file like you can any other file\. For example, you can download, lock, share, or edit any version of a file\. Follow these steps\.

**To use a past version of a file**

1. In the web client, open the file\.

   The file's title appears just below the menu bar, along with a list control that reads **v*X* of *X***\.

**Note**  
If only one version of a file exists, the list control doesn't appear\.

1. Open the **v*X* of *X*** list and select the version you want to view\.

   At this point, you can use any of the commands except **Create**\.
