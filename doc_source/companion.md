# Using Amazon WorkDocs Companion<a name="companion"></a>

Amazon WorkDocs Companion lets you open and edit a file from the web client in one step\. When you edit a file, Companion saves your changes to Amazon WorkDocs as a new file version\.

**Note**  
You never use Companion directly\. All you need to do is work with your files\.

For Windows users, Amazon WorkDocs Companion integrates with File Explorer to let you:
+ Upload multiple files and folders from File Explorer to the Companion Uploads folder under **MyDocs** on the Amazon WorkDocs site\. 
+ Share a link to the uploaded files, or share a link with a 4\-digit passcode\.
