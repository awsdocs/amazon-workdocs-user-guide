# Working with folders<a name="working-folders"></a>

The following topics explain how to work with folders in the Amazon WorkDocs web client and mobile application\.

**Note**  
The web client allows you to do more with folders than the mobile app\. For example, you can only use the web client to download or move folders\.

In the web client, you use the following items to work with folders\.
+  The **Create** menu: ![\[Image showing the Create button on the Amazon WorkDocs menu bar.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/userguide/images/wd-create-command.png) 
+  The **Actions** list, and the buttons next to it: ![\[Image showing the Actions list, and the Share and Upload buttons.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/userguide/images/wd-actions-buttons.png) 

In the Amazon WorkDocs mobile app, you use the ellipsis menu at the top of each folder: ![\[Image showing the ellipsis menu in the Amazon WorkDocs mobile app.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/userguide/images/wd-ellipses.png) 

**Important**  
You must install Amazon WorkDocs Companion to complete some of the tasks listed in this section\. For example, you can't upload or download folders without Companion\. For more information about installing and using Companion, see [Using Amazon WorkDocs Companion](companion.md)\.
