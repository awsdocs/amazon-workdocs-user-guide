# Updating approval requests<a name="update-approval"></a>

You can update your approval requests as long as they have a status of **Pending**\. The changes you can make depend on whether any approvers have responded\.
+ **If an approver hasn't responded** – You can update the files, groups, approvers, due date, and description\.
+ **If an approver has responded, but the approval request is still pending further approvals** – You can add a new approver to a group, remove an approver who has not yet responded, and change the due date\.
