# Downloading folders<a name="download-folders"></a>

**Note**  
You must have Amazon WorkDocs Companion to follow the steps in this topic\. 

The following steps explain how to download folders from the Amazon WorkDocs web client\. Downloading a folder also downloads everything in the folder\. You can only perform this action in the web client\.

**To download folders**

1. Use the credentials provided by your administrator to log in to Amazon WorkDocs\.

1. Select the check boxes next to the folders that you want to download\.

   —OR—

   To download one or more sub\-folders, open the parent folder, and then select the check boxes next to the sub\-folders that you want to download\.
**Note**  
Just select the check box or boxes\. Choosing a folder name opens the folder in Preview mode, and that disables the **Download** command\.

1. Open the **Actions** menu and choose **Download**\.

   On a Windows machine, the **New Folder** dialog box appears and displays the folder's contents\. On a macOS machine, **Finder** appears and does the same\.

**Note**  
On a PC, downloaded folders land by default in **Downloads/WorkDocsDownloads/***folder name*\.  
On a Macintosh, downloaded folders land by default in the *Hard Drive Name***/Users/***User Name***/WorkDocsDownloads**\.
