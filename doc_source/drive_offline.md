You can't always be connected\. But even when you aren't, you can work offline\. Enabling offline access to your files and folders downloads files to your computer\. You then work on them, and upload your changes to Amazon WorkDocs when you go back online\.

Enabling offline access uses network bandwidth to download your content, plus space on your hard drive for storing the files\. Downloads can take time, depending on the number of files and your network bandwidth\.
