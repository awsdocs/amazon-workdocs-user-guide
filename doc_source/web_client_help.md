To get started with the Amazon WorkDocs web client, download and install the Amazon WorkDocs web client from [Apps & Integrations for Amazon WorkDocs](https://amazonworkdocs.com/apps.html)\. The client opens Amazon WorkDocs in any supported browser, and [System requirements](web_client_sys_reqs.md) lists them\. 

You use the web client it to upload, download, and organize your files\. You can upload files of up to 5TB in size, assuming you purchase enough storage space, and you can download a file of any size\.

You can also view and comment on your documents, and documents shared by others\. The web client also displays previews for many different types of files\.
