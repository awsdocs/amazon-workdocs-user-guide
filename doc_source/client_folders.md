## Creating folders<a name="web_create_folder"></a>

You can create folders in these locations:
+ Your **MyDocs** folder\.
+ Folders that you create under **My Docs**\.
+ Folders that others share with you, if they give you owner or co\-owner permissions\.

**To create a folder**

1. Make sure you're in the correct location for the new folder\.

1. Choose **Create**, and then choose **Folder**\.

1. Enter the folder name, and then choose **Create**\.

If your site administrator enables Hancom ThinkFree, you can also create files in the web client\. For more information, see [Editing with Hancom ThinkFree](hancom-online-edit.md)\.

**To create a team folder**

1. Follow the previous steps to create a folder\.

1. Send an invitation to share the folder with your team directory group\. For more information on sharing folders by invitation, see [Sharing by invitation](share-invite.md)\.

If you do not have a team directory group, ask your Amazon WorkDocs site administrator to create one\. Your administrator is the person who invited you to join Amazon WorkDocs\. 

## Renaming and moving files and folders<a name="web_rename_folder"></a>

If you have permissions, you can change the name of a file or folder\. For more information, see [Permissions](permissions.md)\.

**To rename a file or folder**

1. In the web client, select the check box next to the file or folder to be renamed\.
**Note**  
Just select the check box\. Choosing the file or folder name opens the file or folder in Preview mode, and that disables the commands for renaming and moving\.

1. For **Actions**, choose **More**, **Rename**\.

1. Enter the new name, then press **Enter**\.

When you are signed in to the Amazon WorkDocs site, you can sort documents by name, owner, and other attributes\. Use the dropdown arrows in the menu above your documents to do so\. If you have permissions, you can also move files or folders to other folders by following these steps\.

**To move a file or folder**

1. In the web client, select the check box next to the file or folder to be moved\.
**Note**  
Just select the check box\. Choosing the file or folder name opens the file or folder in Preview mode, and that disables the commands for renaming and moving\.

1. For **Actions**, choose **More**, **Move**\.

1. In the dialog box, navigate to the target folder and choose **Move**\.

**Note**  
Moving a folder also moves the files and sub\-folders within the folder\. To move multiple files at the same time, move them into a folder, and then move that folder\.

## Editing files<a name="edit_files"></a>

You can edit a file in the web client\. When you save your edits to a file, the changes are saved to Amazon WorkDocs as a new file version\.

**Note**  
If your site administrator has enabled a collaborative editing feature, you can select that option to edit your file\. For more information, see [Feedback and collaborative editing](collab-editing.md)\.

If you lock the file, you can unlock it when you're done with your changes\. For more information about locking and unlocking files, see [Locking and unlocking files](client_lock_files.md)\.
