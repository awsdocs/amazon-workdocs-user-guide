# Transferring Document Ownership<a name="transfer_owner"></a>

There are two ways to transfer document ownership to other users:
+ If you are a system administrator, you can transfer an inactive user's files and folders to an active user\. For more information, see [Transferring Document Ownership](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/adminguide/transfer-docs.html) in the *Amazon WorkDocs Administration Guide*\.
+ If you are an active user with owner permissions for a document, you can grant other users co\-owner permissions\. Co\-owners have the same permissions as owners except for the ability to delete top\-level folders\. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions](permissions.md)\.

**To assign co\-owner permissions**

1. In the web client, select or open the folder or file to share with a co\-owner\.

1. Choose **Share**, **Invite people**\.

1. Type the name of the user or group in the search box, and then choose **Co\-Owner**\.

1. Choose **Save**\.
