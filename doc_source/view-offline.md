# Viewing files offline<a name="view-offline"></a>

To view files offline, use Amazon WorkDocs Drive\. For more information, see [Using Amazon WorkDocs Drive](workdocs_drive_help.md)\.

If you are using Amazon WorkDocs on your Android or iOS device, you can download any file that you are authorized to by viewing the document and choosing the download icon\. This makes offline files available on your device\. Once you download a file, the download icon changes to a dark background\.

To view your offline files, choose **Offline Documents** in the app\. You can give feedback on a document even when offline\. Your feedback is synchronized to the server the next time you have Internet access\.
