# How versions impact your storage limit<a name="version-storage"></a>

Your Amazon WorkDocs subscription includes a certain amount of cloud storage space, and file versions count toward that limit\.

The amount of space depends on your subscription\. If you exceed your limit, you can ask your Amazon WorkDocs site administrator for more space\. AWS bills you for the additional space\. For more information about storage limits and rates, see the [WorkDocs Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/workdocs/pricing/)\.
