The Amazon WorkDocs Android phone and tablet applications allow you to view, comment on, and download your Amazon WorkDocs files\. You can also view, give feedback on, and download other documents if you have permissions to do so\.

Download the Android application from Google Play or the Amazon Appstore for Android, and sign in with your organization name, user name, and password\. The welcome email message from your administrator has the organization and user names, and you set the password when you registered\. For more information, see [Step 2: Register](user_registration.md)\.

To reset your password, choose **Forgot password** on the sign\-in screen\. If you need more help with signing in, contact your Amazon WorkDocs administrator\.
