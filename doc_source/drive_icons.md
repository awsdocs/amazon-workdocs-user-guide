# Understanding the Amazon WorkDocs Drive file icons<a name="drive_icons"></a>

Amazon WorkDocs Drive uses these icons to communicate file status:
+ **Gray arrow**–A file is syncing to the cloud\.
+ **Blue cloud**–A file resides in the cloud\.
+ **Green checkmark**–A file resides on your device\.
+ **Blue star**–You marked a file or folder as a Favorite\.
+ **Red lock**–You or another user locked the file for editing\.
**Note**  
As a best practice, always lock your files for editing\. If you and another user work on a file simultaneously, your changes can overwrite each other\.
