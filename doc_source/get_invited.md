# Step 1: Get invited<a name="get_invited"></a>

You must be invited to join an Amazon WorkDocs organization\. Your Amazon WorkDocs administrator creates an organization and invites you and other users to join\. The administrator can also grant "invite" privileges to people in the organization, and in turn they can invite others to join\. 

Your Amazon WorkDocs administrator sends you an email message with the information needed to log in and register—if necessary—and instructions on how to download the client applications\.

**Important**  
Save your invitation email, or save the address of the person who sent the email\. You may need to contact that person for help with tasks that only administrators can do, such as enabling Hancom Thinkfree\.
