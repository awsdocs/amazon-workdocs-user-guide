# Step 1: Get invited<a name="get_invited"></a>

You must be invited to join an Amazon WorkDocs organization\. Your Amazon WorkDocs administrator creates an organization and invites you and other users to join\. The administrator can also grant "invite" privileges to people in the organization, and in turn they can invite others to join\. 

Your Amazon WorkDocs administrator sends you an email message with the information needed to log in and register—if necessary—and instructions on how to download the client applications\.
