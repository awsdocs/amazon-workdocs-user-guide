# End\-of\-life FAQs<a name="eol-faq"></a>

**Important**  
Amazon WorkDocs Companion is reaching end of life and will no longer be available starting on **November 15, 2023**, the end of Life \(EOL\) date\.

## What's changing?<a name="whats-changing"></a>

Starting on November 15, 2023, Amazon WorkDocs Drive will enable you to edit a document from the web, much like Companion does now\. Between January, 2023, and November 15, 2023, you can use Drive or Companion to edit WorkDocs content on your desktop\. After November 15th, 2023, Amazon WorkDocs Companion will go offline, with its key features merged into Amazon WorkDocs Drive\.

## How will the edit with Companion feature be impacted?<a name="how-edit-impacted"></a>

In January 2023, the button to edit in a companion app will change to edit in desktop app\. The edit in desktop app functionality will be available for users of WorkDocs Drive\.

## I use Companion and Drive\. How will the edit\-in\-desktop app work after January 2023?<a name="how-edit-will-work"></a>

If you have Companion and Drive installed, you can use either one with the WorkDocs files on your device\. After November 15, 2023, the edit\-in\-desktop app function will only be available on WorkDocs Drive\. 

## Is there an alternative to the edit\-in\-Companion\-app feature?<a name="alternatives"></a>

Yes\. WorkDocs Drive allows you to lock and edit documents without starting from the web\. Double\-clicking the document opens the file in your default editor\.

## Can I use Drive to lock documents?<a name="lock-docs"></a>

Yes\. In Drive, right\-click the file and choose **Lock document**\. This avoids creating new versions each time you save the document\. Locking also prevents others from overwriting the document\.

## I use Companion for bulk downloads\. Is that going away?<a name="bulk-downloads"></a>

No\. After November 15, 2023, this feature will be available on the Amazon WorkDocs web client, and you will no longer need a desktop client to download more than one file or folder\. You can also use Amazon WorkDocs Drive to keep your files and folders locally on your device so you won't need to download files\. 

## I use Companion to download user reports\. Is that going away?<a name="user-reports"></a>

No\. However, after November 15, 2023, this feature will only be available on the Amazon WorkDocs administrative console\. You won't need a desktop client to download user reports\.

## I use WorkDocs Companion, do I need to upgrade now?<a name="upgrade-companion"></a>

No, you can keep using Companion until November 15th, 2023\. To avoid disruptions in workflow, please upgrade to WorkDocs Drive before November 15th, 2023\.

## I use WorkDocs Drive, what should I do?<a name="drive-user"></a>

No action is required\. In a future update, Amazon WorkDocs Drive will enable you to edit documents, similar to Amazon WorkDocs Companion\.
