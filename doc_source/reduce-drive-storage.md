# Reducing the number of Amazon WorkDocs Drive versions<a name="reduce-drive-storage"></a>

For greater safety and convenience, Amazon WorkDocs Drive stores all versions of a file, and it automatically creates new versions of the file every 30 seconds while you modify the file\.

If you download large files directly to Amazon WorkDocs Drive, and the download time exceeds 30 seconds, the system creates multiple versions of those big files\. To prevent those unwanted versions, download the files to a local folder, and then copy them from there to Amazon WorkDocs Drive\.

For existing files with multiple versions, you can delete the files from Amazon WorkDocs and upload them from your local drive\. That removes the unwanted versions and reclaims the storage space\.
