# Taking actions on files<a name="file-actions"></a>

You can create, rename, move, and delete files in Amazon WorkDocs Drive\. Moving files out of Amazon WorkDocs Drive sends them to the **Recycle bin** on your site\.

**Note**  
If you add files to a folder, and those files have identical names but different upper and lowercase letters, only one of the files appears in Amazon WorkDocs\. For example, if you have `MyFile.doc` and `myFile.doc`, only one of those files appears on the site\. The operating system controls which file appears\.  
Also, if multiple users edit a file simultaneously, their changes can overwrite each other\. To avoid editing conflicts, always lock a file whenever you need to change it\. See the steps in the next section for information about locking files\.
