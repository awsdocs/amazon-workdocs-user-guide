# Switching visual themes<a name="switch-themes"></a>

The Amazon WorkDocs iOS app provides two visual themes, Light and Dark\. The Dark theme inverts the display, so you see white text on a black background\. Amazon WorkDocs uses the Light theme by default, but you can switch themes at any time\. You can use the theme that you prefer, but remember that the Dark theme can help with accessibility\. It may also help reduce eye strain and extend battery life\.

You change the theme in your system settings, not in Amazon WorkDocs\.

**To switch visual themes**

1. Open your iOS system settings and choose **Theme**\.

1. Choose **Light** or **Dark**\.
