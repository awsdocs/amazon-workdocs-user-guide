# Sharing feedback<a name="feedback"></a>

Other people in your organization can request feedback from you on specific files\. You can add feedback to a file, or add a message about the entire file\. You can also reply to feedback, give private feedback, and decline to give feedback\.

You can see the files for which your feedback has been requested in your **Awaiting my feedback** list\. To request feedback, you can share your document with other people in your organization\. For more information, see [Sharing files and folders](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/userguide/share-docs.html)\.

## Adding feedback<a name="add_feedback"></a>

You can add overall feedback that applies to the entire file, or add feedback on a portion of a file\. 

**To add overall feedback**

## Replying to feedback<a name="reply-to-feedback"></a>

When you reply to feedback, everyone with permissions to the file sees your feedback by default\. However, you can reply privately\. The following sets of steps explain how to send public and private replies\.

## Notifying others about feedback<a name="feedback-notifications"></a>

**To notify a user in feedback**

When you want a user to pay attention to a comment, you can notify that user\. The user receives the comment in email\.

1. In the comment box, choose the **@** button and then choose the user name from the list that appears\. Or, type **@** followed by the user name \(for example, @username\)\.

1. The user specified automatically receives an email message that includes your comment and a link to view the file\.

## Formatting feedback<a name="format-feedback"></a>
