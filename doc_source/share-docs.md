# Sharing files and folders<a name="share-docs"></a>

You can share folders and files with other users, inside and outside of your organization\. You can share by sending a link or an invitation to a user's email address\. When you share by invitation, you can choose which permissions the user has\. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions](permissions.md)\.

You can also revoke permissions, and users can remove themselves from a shared item\. 

**Note**  
You can only share with directory groups, not email distribution lists\.
