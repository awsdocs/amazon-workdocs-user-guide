# Sharing Files and Folders<a name="share-docs"></a>

You can share a folder or file with other users and groups both within and outside your organization\. Share by sending a link, or share by sending an invite to a user's email address\. When you share by invite, you choose which permissions to grant to the users that you're sharing with\. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions](permissions.md)\.

You can also revoke shares, and users can remove themselves from the share\. To see a list of users that have access to a file or folder, select the file or folder, then choose **Share**, **Permissions**\.

To see a list of all the changes that users have made to your files and folders, view your activity feed\. For more information, see [Tracking File Activity](activity_feed.md)\.

**Note**  
You can only share with directory groups, not email distribution lists\.
