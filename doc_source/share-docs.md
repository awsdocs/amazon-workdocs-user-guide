# Sharing files and folders<a name="share-docs"></a>

You can share files and folders with other users, inside and outside of your organization\. You can share by inviting other users, or by emailing links to files or folders\. When you share by invitation, you can choose which permissions the user has\. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions](permissions.md)\.

You can also revoke permissions, and users can remove themselves from a shared item\. 

**Note**  
You can only share with directory groups, not email distribution lists\.
