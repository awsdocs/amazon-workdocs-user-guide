# Signing in<a name="web_login"></a>

When you launch the Amazon WorkDocs web client for the first time, you sign in with your organization name, user name, and password\. The welcome email message from your administrator has the organization and user names, and you set the password when you registered\. For more information, see [Step 2: Register](user_registration.md)\. 

If your Amazon WorkDocs administrator has enabled multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) for your organization, you are also prompted for a passcode to finish signing in\. Your Amazon WorkDocs administrator provides information about how to get your passcode\.

To reset your password, choose **Forgot password** on the sign\-in screen\. If you need more help with signing in, contact your administrator\.
