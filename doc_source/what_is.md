Amazon WorkDocs enables you to store, manage, share, and collaborate on files with your coworkers\. Amazon WorkDocs stores your files in [the cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/)\. Your files are only visible to you and your designated contributors and reviewers\. Other members of your organization can't open, read, or change your files unless you grant them access\.

You can share your files with other members of your organization for collaboration or review, and you can view many different types of files, including all common document and image formats\.
