# Working with files<a name="working-files"></a>

The following topics explain how to work with files in the Amazon WorkDocs web client and mobile application\.

**Note**  
The web client allows you to do more with files than the mobile app\. For example, you can only use the web client to move files\.

In the web client, you use the following items to work with files\.
+  The **Create** menu: ![\[Image showing the Create button on the Amazon WorkDocs menu bar.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/userguide/images/wd-create-command.png) 
+  The **Actions** list, and the buttons next to it: ![\[Image showing the Actions list, and the Share, Edit, and Upload buttons.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/userguide/images/wd-file-actions-buttons.png) 

In the Amazon WorkDocs mobile app, you use the ellipsis menu at the top of each file icon: ![\[Image showing the ellipsis menu in the Amazon WorkDocs mobile app.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/userguide/images/wd-ellipses.png) 

**Important**  
You must install Amazon WorkDocs Companion to complete some of the tasks listed in this section\. For example, you can't upload or download files without Companion\. For more information about installing and using Companion, see [Using Amazon WorkDocs Companion](companion.md)\.
